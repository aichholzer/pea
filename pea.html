SPP is a small and simple scripting engine designed do teach the basics of an intepreted language. The SPP engine is built as a very small copy of PHP.
The script intepreter is build up by three main blocks, the lexer that reads the source script and reduces it to a stream of integer tokens, one value
for every keyword in the language. The parser that check the syntax of the language and writes a stream of operations. And the execution engine that
inteprets the operations and executes the script.
